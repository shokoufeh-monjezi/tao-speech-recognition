    "Training a model using TAO is as simple as configuring your spec file and running the train command. The code cell below uses the default train.yaml available for users as reference. It is configured by default to use the `bert-base-uncased` pretrained model. Additionally, these configurations could easily be overridden using the tao-launcher CLI as shown below. For instance, below we override the `training_ds.file`, `validation_ds.file`, `trainer.max_epochs`, `training_ds.num_workers` and `validation_ds.num_workers` configurations to suit our needs. We encourage you to take a look at the .yaml spec files we provide! <br>\n",

    "- `-k`: User specified encryption key to use while saving/loading the model\n",

However, TAO does provide a command for fine-tuning if your use-case demands that. Instead of `tao question_answering train`, we use `tao question_answering finetune` instead. We also specify the spec file corresponding to fine-tuning. All commands in TAO follow a similar pattern, streamlining the workflow even further!\n",
